# Policy Against Harassment at CPM 2025

This document is an adaptation to CPM 2025 of the “Policy Against Harassment at ACM
Activities”, available at

[https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment)

A downloadble pdf of this document is [available here](img/coc.pdf).

It is shared with registered participants of the CPM 2025 conference, in the context of the
SafeToC initiative. The open exchange of ideas is central to the CPM 2025 conference. This
requires an environment that embraces diversity and provides a safe, welcoming
environment for all. This policy applies to all activities related with CPM 2025, including:

- the conference and the social events;
- exchanges among committees associated with the CPM 2025 conference.

## Expected Behavior

We expect all participants in CPM 2025 to abide by this policy in all venues, including
ancillary events and unofficial social gatherings:

- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions;
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech;
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants;
- Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or
violations of this policy, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable at the CPM 2025 conference is:

**Abuse:** Any action directed at an individual that (a) interferes substantially with that person’s
participation; or (b) causes that person to fear for his/her personal safety. This includes
threats, intimidation, bullying, stalking, or other types of abuse.

**Discriminatory Harassment:** Any conduct that discriminates or denigrates an individual on
the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, citizenship, nationality, age, sexual or gender identity,
disability, or any other characteristic protected by law in the location where CPM 2025 takes
place.

**Sexual Harassment:** Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other
verbal/physical conduct of a sexual nature. Examples include (but are not limited to):

- unwelcome advances or propositions, particularly when one individual has authority
over the other;
- inappropriate touching of an individual’s body;
- degrading or humiliating comments about an individual’s appearance;
- using an activity-related communication channel to display or distribute sexually
explicit images or messages.

Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or
violations of this policy, even if they seem inconsequential. Unacceptable behaviors include,
but are not limited to:

- intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or
actions by any participant in CPM 2025, at all related events and in one-on-one
communications carried out in the context of CPM 2025;
- offensive, degrading, humiliating, harmful, or prejudicial verbal or written comments
or visual images related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, age,
appearance, or other personal characteristics;
- unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal/physical
conduct of a sexual nature;
- inappropriate or gratuitous use of nudity, sexual images, or stereotyped images
including using an activity-related communication channel to display or distribute
sexually explicit or otherwise offensive or discriminatory images or messages;
- deliberate intimidation, stalking or following;
- harassing photography or recording;
- sustained disruption of talks or other events;
- unwelcome and uninvited attention or contact;
- physical assault (including unwelcome touch or groping);
- real or implied threat of physical harm;
- real or implied threat of professional or financial damage or harm.

Harassment can occur when there is no deliberate intention to offend. Be careful in the
words that you choose. Harassment committed in a joking manner or disguised as a
compliment still constitutes unacceptable behavior. Remember that sexist, racist,
homophobic and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Consequences of unacceptable behavior may include:

- being removed from the conference without warning or refund;
- being prohibited from participating in future CPM conferences.

Appropriate sanctions also will be taken toward any individual who knowingly makes a false
allegation of harassment.

### How to Report Unacceptable Behavior

Any individual who experiences harassment (as described above) at the CPM 2025
conference should report to the PC chairs and/or the Steering Committee members. We
encourage you to seek advice and remedy through the report.

### Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Policy Against
Harassment at CPM 2025 you should notify the PC chairs and/or the Steering Committee
members, with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be thoroughly
investigated.

## Warnings and Disclaimers

This Policy Against Harassment at CPM 2025 is not intended to limit open discussion of the
merits of particular work or issues presented at CPM 2025. It applies only to behavior at
CPM 2025. The CPM 2025 organizing committee assumes no liability or responsibility for
the actions of any member or other activity participant. The CPM 2025 organizing committee
is not responsible for protecting the safety of members or participants in CPM 2025. Any
individual who feels his/her safety is at risk due to harassment or for any other reason is
encouraged to take appropriate steps to ensure personal safety.
