# How to reach us

# Accommodation

We suggest to book a room at [Starhotel Tourist](https://www.starhotels.com/en/)
or [Hotel Arcimboldi](https://hotelarcimboldi.it/) which are both within walking
distance from the conference venue.

If you prefer to be closer to downtown and still reach quickly the conference
venue, we suggest the [Tocq hotel](https://www.tocq.it/) and the [NH Collection
Milano Porta
Nuova](https://www.nh-hotels.com/en/hotel/nh-collection-milano-porta-nuova)
which are both close to [Piazza Gae
Aulenti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Gae_Aulenti), one of the newest
Milan landmarks.
From there, you can take the subway and arrive at the conference in 20 minutes.
