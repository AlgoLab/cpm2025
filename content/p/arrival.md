# Accommodation

We suggest to book a room at [Starhotel Tourist](https://reservations.starhotels.com/100462?adults=1&children=0&currency=EUR&datein=6/15/2025&hotelID=100462&nights=5#/accommodation/room)
or [Hotel Arcimboldi](https://hotelarcimboldi.it/) which are both within walking
distance from the conference venues.

If you prefer to be closer to downtown and still reach quickly the conference
venue, we suggest the [Tocq hotel](https://www.tocq.it/) and the [NH Collection
Milano Porta
Nuova](https://www.nh-hotels.com/en/hotel/nh-collection-milano-porta-nuova)
which are both close to [Piazza Gae
Aulenti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Gae_Aulenti), one of the newest
Milan landmarks. 
From there, you can take Metro M5 and arrive at the conference venue in around 20 minutes via Bicocca-M5 stop.

Otherwise, more convenient solutions can be found in around Milano Central Station, like [Biocity Hotel](https://www.biocityhotel.it).
From there, you can take bus 87 or 81 and arrive at the conference venue in around 20 minutes.
