The university provides some
[instructions](https://en.unimib.it/reach-us/how-reach-us) on how to reach us
(follow the instruction for the Campus of Milan).

If you land at Malpensa Airport (MXP) you can take the [Malpensa Express
train](https://www.malpensaexpress.it/en/) to Milano Centrale or Milano Cadorna
(either is fine) where you can take the subway to reach the conference site.
**There is a train strike on Monday 16**: trains might be replaced by buses.
Additionally, there are some bus companies connecting MXP to Milano, [Malpensa
Shuttle](https://www.malpensashuttle.it/) and
[Terravision](https://www.terravision.eu/airport_transfer/busmalpensa-airport-milan/?noredirect=en_US)

If you land at Linate Airport (LIN) you can take the new subway line [MM4
line](https://www.atm.it/en/ViaggiaConNoi/InfoTraffico/Pages/M4passengerserviceinformation2.aspx).

If you land at Milan-Bergamo airport, you can take the bus [Orio
Shuttle](https://www.milano-aeroporti.it/orio-shuttle/en/index.html) to reach
Milano Centrale.


# Accommodation

We suggest to book a room at [Starhotel Tourist](https://reservations.starhotels.com/100462?adults=1&children=0&currency=EUR&datein=6/15/2025&hotelID=100462&nights=5#/accommodation/room)
or [Hotel Arcimboldi](https://hotelarcimboldi.it/) which are both within walking
distance from the conference venues.

If you prefer to be closer to downtown and still reach quickly the conference
venue, we suggest the [Tocq hotel](https://www.tocq.it/) and the [NH Collection
Milano Porta
Nuova](https://www.nh-hotels.com/en/hotel/nh-collection-milano-porta-nuova)
which are both close to [Piazza Gae
Aulenti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Gae_Aulenti), one of the newest
Milan landmarks. 
From there, you can take Metro M5 and arrive at the conference venue in around 20 minutes via Bicocca-M5 stop.

Otherwise, more convenient solutions can be found in around Milano Central Station, like [Biocity Hotel](https://www.biocityhotel.it).
From there, you can take bus 87 or 81 and arrive at the conference venue in around 20 minutes.
