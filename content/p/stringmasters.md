# Stringmasters

Just before and after CPM 2025, there will be a StringMasters workshop on June 16 and 20. 
The venue for StringMasters is TBA, at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

The workshop is organized by Zsuzsanna Lipták and Golnaz Badkobeh. 
You can reach the organizers at stringmasters.milano.2025@gmail.com

## Format and Purpose

StringMasters was established with the aim of bringing together researchers in string algorithms at all levels (senior, junior, especially graduate students) to study current problems of particular theoretical and practical interest. It is informal, with no scheduled presentations, entirely devoted to new research resulting from the interactions among the participants.

Typically small impromptu groups form, of about 2 to 5 researchers, who share a common interest in a problem. Old collaborations are reinforced, and new collaborations are formed. The workshop is accomodated in several meeting rooms to allow space for the parallel working groups and for general milling around.

All interested participants are welcome, around 25-35 participants are expected.
Topics

StringMasters research covers all topics related to string algorithms,
combinatorics on words, and applications, including but not restricted to:

  • Bioinformatics and computational biology
  • Coding and data compression
  • Combinatorics on words
  • Data mining
  • Information retrieval
  • Natural language processing
  • Pattern discovery
  • String algorithms
  • String processing in databases
  • Symbolic computing
  • Text searching and indexing
  • any other topics related to text algorithms and data structures


StringMasters welcomes participants with interest in any aspect of string algorithms, theoretical or applied.

Participation is free
